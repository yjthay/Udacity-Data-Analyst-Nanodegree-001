    "A few researchers set out to determine the optimal length of chopsticks for children and adults. They came up with a measure of how effective a pair of chopsticks performed, called the \"Food Pinching Performance.\" The \"Food Pinching Performance\" was determined by counting the number of peanuts picked and placed in a cup (PPPC).\n",

    "Chopsticks are one of the most simple and popular hand tools ever invented by humans, but have not previously been investigated by [ergonomists](https://www.google.com/search?q=ergonomists). Two laboratory studies were conducted in this research, using a [randomised complete block design](http://dawg.utk.edu/glossary/whatis_rcbd.htm), to evaluate the effects of the length of the chopsticks on the food-serving performance of adults and children. Thirty-one male junior college students and 21 primary school pupils served as subjects for the experiment to test chopsticks lengths of 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 330 mm. The results showed that the food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 and 180 mm long were optimal for adults and pupils, respectively. Based on these findings, the researchers suggested that families with children should provide both 240 and 180 mm long chopsticks. In addition, restaurants could provide 210 mm long chopsticks, considering the trade-offs between ergonomics and cost.\n",

    "### In the abstract the researchers stated that their results showed food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 mm long were optimal for adults.\n",

    "#### 7a. Based on the data you have analyzed, do you agree with the claim?\n",
    "Yes to a certain extent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7b. Why?\n",
    "The efficiency of food pinching peaks at around 240mm as seen on the scatterplot above and we can see that the efficiency of food pinching varies as the length of the chopsticks changes.  However, the sample size is rather small and only a single independent variable is used.  Thus, we should not generalise it to the whole population (i.e. stating that about 240 mm long were optimal for adults).  For example, there is no control over what type of chopsticks were used. A chopstick with rounded edges might have a different optimal length for adults as compared to a chopstick with squared edges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also the length of the chopsticks could affect the food pinching efficiency due to the size of the participant's hand or the finger to palm ratio of the participant.  In itself, it could be insignificant but since we do not have parameters measuring hand size or finger to palm ratios, length of chopsticks becomes a proxy for these variables and hence look like it significiantly affects the food pinching performance\n",
